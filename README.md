# GestureDrive
A retro-style driving game where vehicle on screen is controlled by hand movement read through webcam. 
Image recognition was done using **Tensorflow** and model was trained on the **Egohands dataset**. 
Game was developed using **PyGame**. Goal of the game is to drive through endless road and avoid obstacles for as long as possible,
overtime vehicle speed increases and it becomes more difficult to avoid other vehicles.

**Disclaimer:** Assets used in game are not my own, and Victor Dibia's hand-tracking tutorial was used and incredibly helpful in making this game.
